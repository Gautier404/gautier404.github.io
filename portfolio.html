            <h1>My Cad Portfolio!</h1>
            <p>I just started CAD at the beggining of my first quarter, so I don't have a lot of original work to showcase. There will definetly be more here in the future though!</p>
            <p>Here is a wind up snail I created with cute little blue boots! It utilizes 10 parts and a clock spring from McMaster. If I ever get the chance to print or machine it, all the gears should mesh together properly.</p>

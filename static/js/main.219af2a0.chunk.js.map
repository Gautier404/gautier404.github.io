The first time they swipe into a dining hall they pair their account to their bruin card by scanning a QR code generated by our hardware system.  They then can see where their friends are eating and what food the dining halls are serving. Each user has their own personal QR code that other students can use to add them as friends.

Most of my work revolved around how the app would be used and how our product was presented so there was a lot of communication between me and the rest of the team about the mechanics of our system. They are all much better at programing and electronics than I am, so I ended up picking up a lot of knowledge about mobile development, databases, rfid scanners, and Bluetooth. </p>\r\n                <h2>Tools I used</h2>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>Figma & Illustrator for the the wireframe and assets</li>\r\n                    <li>React Native with Expo</li>\r\n                    <li>A Nikon digital camera for the shaky cinematography in our demo</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </div>\r\n    },\r\n    {   \r\n        title:\"Synthesizer\",\r\n        priority: 4,\r\n        mPriority: 5,\r\n        links: {\r\n            github: \"https://github.com/Gautier404/cigar-box-synth\",\r\n        },\r\n        summary:\"During the pandemic I built a membrane potentiometer synth with some cool software and hardware filters.\",\r\n        date:\"September 13th 2021\",\r\n        image:Synth,\r\n        content: \r\n            <div>\r\n                <h2>Inspiration</h2>\r\n                <p>This was not the first time someone has built a synthesizer using a membrane potentiometer.

As you would expect when I did assemble everything my code was a buggy mess! I had to spend another couple hours debugging the software which wasn’t so fun. This was also my first time programming in C++ so there were lots of errors I didn’t understand. Next time I do a project I will definitely assemble the components first and then methodically iterate my code.</p>\r\n                <p>Membrane Potentiometer Signal Noise</p>\r\n                <p>Once I received my membrane potentiometer in the mail and hooked it up to my Arduino, I realized the signal was very noisy which made the speaker alternate between notes in not so nice sounding ways. I ended programming a smoothing function within my code to average out the past 10 readings in order to smooth out the signal.</p>\r\n                <p>Membrane Potentiometer sending Signal when not depressed</p>\r\n                <p>When I removed my hand from the membrane potentiometer the speaker would still play. Having space between notes in music is vital so I added a pulldown resistor to the membrane potentiometer which had it send a signal of 0 when not being played. I found this solution online from a blog by Russel Smith. The drawback of this solution is that the readings from the membrane potentiometer were no longer linear. To fix this I took readings of the potentiometer at 2 cm intervals. Using excel, I calculated a polynomial that did a decent job of linearizing the data and incorporated it into the readpot() function in my code.</p>\r\n            </div>,\r\n    },\r\n    {   \r\n        title:\"Animade Easy\",\r\n        priority: 3,\r\n        mPriority: 2,\r\n        links: {\r\n            github: \"https://github.com/css-animations/animade-easy\",\r\n            devpost: \"https://devpost.com/software/animade-easy\",\r\n            figma: \"https://www.figma.com/file/vkMPhKmJ1m4u2EcQZQwR0P/NOtJAMALAM?node-id=0%3A1\"\r\n        },\r\n        summary:\"Animade Easy is a devtools extension I created with friends during Penn Apps 2021 that makes creating custom CSS animations super easy.\",\r\n        image: Animade,\r\n        date:\"September 13th 2021\",\r\n        content: \r\n            <div>\r\n                <h2>Inspiration</h2>\r\n                <p>When I was making my personal website, I learned how to create CSS animations. I found that typing out an animation was pretty far removed from how animation is typically done so I proposed that we create a mash up of React Dev Tools, animation software, and a CSS development website like <a href = \"https://cssgradient.io/\">CSS Gradient</a>. My friend Jake wanted to learn how to create Bezier curves and my friend Mathew wanted to learn about code injection with a devtools extension, so we went with the idea. </p>\r\n                <h2>How it works</h2>\r\n                <Video link=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbXtdEvrIVo\" description =\"Demo video created 10 minutes before the hackathon deadline. Hopefully we'll have a better one soon :)\"></Video>\r\n                <p>Once we get everything flushed out we plan to put this on the chrome web store like a regular extension. After getting our extension you’ll be able to open dev tools like normal and open our add on by selecting the Animade Easy Tab. </p>\r\n                <p>After hitting the Attach Animation button, you can select what element on your webpage you want to animate by clicking on it. I’m not entirely sure how this works because Mathew programed this feature, but I think we inspect the dom and inject css to draw boxes around what is being selected. We plan on letting you select which css properties you want to animate but right now we have size and rotation hardcoded in.  There are also some other animation options you can add to the property like if you want it to loop or not. </p>\r\n                <p>The animation can be modified with the Bezier curve tool Jake built. When you modify the handles and keyframes it builds the CSS code that is injected when you hit play to animate your website! The CSS code is displayed below the Bezier curve for you to copy into your website. We have a copy to clipboard button but it doesn’t work for devtools security reasons.</p>\r\n                <p>You can create very complex animations with this tool compared typing them out by hand. I put a lot of thought into the UI so I’m very proud with what we have so far. We definitely can release this on the chrome store but with school starting soon we’ll see how much time we have to flush it out.</p>\r\n                <h2>Stuff learned</h2>\r\n                <p>This was the most complex web application I’ve created in 36 hours, so we made a lot of mistakes. There was a big disconnect between the front end and backend team with how the workflow of this app was supposed to work so splicing everything together at 4 AM an hour before the deadline was a gigantic mess. If I were to do this over again, I would have communicated how the user was supposed to use our extension better and set up a solid data structure for the front and backend to anchor themselves to.  We originally had a super simple MVP in the works for the first half hour of the hackathon, but we pretty much threw iterative design out the window to create an application with all the cool features we wanted. We were lucky when everything fit together in the end, but I think it would have been better to build a framework that works and then add all our cool features. </p>\r\n                <p>Besides some project management skills, I learned how to use TypeScript for React. Typescript is pretty nice, so I think I’ll use it for my projects in the future. I also got to put the React skills I learned making this website to the test when I built the components of the app. I had to do a lot of wrangling to get the timeline to work but I’m proud I was able to get it to work. I’ve always been the make things pretty guy for my friends’ projects, so I’ve been doing a lot of designing. I can tell I’m getting better because the wireframe for this app looks clean!</p>\r\n                <Picture link = {Jamalam} description = \"Can’t design a wireframe without a crazy mess!\" height =\"50vh\"></Picture>\r\n                <Picture link = {NotJamalam} description = \"Polished Mockup.

I had built a simple html website before, but it was more like a resume with personality, and I didn’t like how it looked. I wanted a website to showcase my projects, for it to be easy to update, and to look nice!  </p>\r\n                <h2>How I made it</h2>\r\n                <p>This summer I got into cyanotyping which is where you paint some chemicals onto paper or fabric, expose it to the sun, and develop it in water to form a blue image. I like how cyanotypes look so I made this website look like one of my prints! All the textures you see come from a free texture pack from <a href = \"https://www.truegrittexturesupply.com/\">true grit texture</a> supply I recently got. </p>\r\n                <Picture link = {Cyanotypes} description = \"Some of the cyanotypes I made this summer!\" height = \"20vw\"></Picture>\r\n                <p>The framework was simple. I wanted a little header with my face and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub and a bunch of cards for my projects. Each card is a react component that reads an object with all the information for each project. To create a new project, I add it to the object and my site automatically makes a card for it! </p>\r\n                <p>I’m planning on showing this website to recruiters but I also want to put all the projects I work on here so I created a switch that sorts the projects between what I would want to show a recruiter and show my friends. Getting an animation for when the cards switch was difficult. React re renders components by deleting them and re adding them to the dom of a website, so programming an animation function by hand was completely above my head. I decided to use the React <a href = \"https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-flip-move\">Flip Move library</a> Because I would rather spend my time making the rest of the website.</p>\r\n                <p>Having a massive page with all my projects wasn’t practical or pretty so I modified my card component to expand if the user wanted to learn more about the project it displays. This was particularly challenging to me because I had to use a ref to calculate the height of the card to animate the card expanding and contracting. I also had to store the state of expansion of each card in an array one level up from the card because when an opened card got moved by my switch the card that took its position would open instead of the original card. </p>\r\n                <p>After my fun part of making the framework, I got to write all the content. Writing is not exactly my favorite thing but writing about stuff I’m interested in has been alright. Its forcing me to do a better job of documenting the stuff I do which is important to show recruiters and just nice to look back at.</p>\r\n                <h2>Stuff learned</h2>\r\n                <p>I think I got better at project management skills while making this website. I put thought into what the purpose of this website would be and what I needed to get done while working on it. It took me four days to create the framework which is pretty good despite my inexperience with react. I am trying to get better at documentation so I kept a log of my progress which I will for sure do with my future projects.  </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n    },\r\n    {   \r\n        title:\"ECVT Sheave Flange\",\r\n        priority: 1,\r\n        mPriority: 1,\r\n        links: {\r\n        },\r\n        summary:\"Coming soon :)\",\r\n        date:\"September 13th 2021\",\r\n        image:Flange,\r\n        content: \r\n            <div>\r\n                <h2>I told you, coming soon >:(</h2>\r\n            </div>,\r\n    },\r\n    {   \r\n        title:\"Print Gallery\",\r\n        priority: 4,\r\n        mPriority: 2,\r\n        links: {\r\n            },\r\n        image: CyanoHeader,\r\n        summary:\"Outside of engineering I like to create prints.

I begin making my cyanotypes by creating a 200 mL solution of 36 grams Ferric Ammonium Citrate and 20 grams Potassium Ferricyanide. This must be done in the dark because the chemicals will start to react in sunlight. I then paint the solution onto the material I want to print on. Most of the time I use watercolor paper but one time I printed on a shirt. Next, I make my negatives. When I first began printing I used plants from my backyard but recently I create designs digitally and print them onto translucent vinyl paper. I create a sandwich of glass, the negative, the printing material, and something rigid on and expose the print to the sun. It takes about 8 minutes of exposure for vinyl negatives and 25 minutes for plants. When photons in the UV spectrum from the sun hit the Ferric Ammonium Citrate a reaction occurs which allows Iron to combine with the Potassium Ferricyanide to form Prussian Blue. But because the chemicals are trapped in the fibers of the paper I need to develop the print in water so they are able to react with each Then all I have to do is let my print dry!</p>\r\n                <h2>The Gallery</h2>\r\n                <p>I first learned about cyanotypes by watching a Nile Red video where he synthesized the components of Prussian Blue, the pigment in cyanotypes, from scratch. I found the process of making cyanotypes fascinating and I planned on trying to make my own for my AP chemistry final project at the end of Senior Year. But because of the pandemic that never ended up happening. The following year I started researching printing methods to procrastinate studying for my spring quarter finals. I ended up ordering the chemicals to arrive as soon as school was out. This is what I made.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <Gallery galleryItems = {CyanotypeGallery}></Gallery>\r\n            </div>\r\n    },\r\n    // {   \r\n    //     title:\"Actuator Controls System\",\r\n    //     priority: 0,\r\n    //     mPriority: 6,\r\n    //     links: {\r\n    //         github: \"https://github.com/Bruin-Racing-Baja/MOAT\",\r\n    //         },\r\n    //     image: ActuatorProfile,\r\n    //     summary:\"I am currently implementing the controls system for a dune buggy's electric continuously variable transmission.\",\r\n    //     content: \r\n    //         <div>\r\n    //             <Video link=\"https://youtube.com/embed/OrqwldYKF2g\" description =\"The actuator mounted on a 3d printed test bed\"></Video>\r\n    //         </div>\r\n    // },\r\n    {   \r\n        title:\"My 3D Prints\",\r\n        priority: 0,\r\n        mPriority: 3,\r\n        links: {\r\n            },\r\n        image: PoodleProfile,\r\n        summary:\"The bits and bobs I print at UCLA's makerspace.\",\r\n        content: \r\n            <div>\r\n                <Gallery galleryItems = {ThreeDPrints}></Gallery>\r\n            </div>\r\n    },\r\n    {   \r\n        title:\"The Kareoketron 9000\",\r\n        priority: 0,\r\n        mPriority: 4.5,\r\n        links: {\r\n            github: \"https://github.com/Gautier404/kareoke\",\r\n            },\r\n        image: KareokeProfile,\r\n        summary:\"A simple sound player and listener I created for Physics Lab Fall Sophomore year.\",\r\n        content: \r\n            <div>\r\n                <h2>Functionality</h2>\r\n                <Video link=\"https://youtube.com/embed/kFo-WVT7Ql4\" description =\"Here I am using the Kareoketron 9000.

If the note they sing back is within one percent of the desired frequency the green led light is turned on to show they hit the correct pitch. Over the course of two seconds the Teensy 4.0 microcontroller averages together what it hears. I used the notefrequency() function from the Audio library that came with the Teensy. After the Teensy determines the average note sung, it flashes a light to show how close you were to the note overall. As you hopefully can tell from the video green is within one percent of the original note, orange is within twenty-five percent, and red is for when you completely miss the note. This process is repeated for five notes and the result of the test is printed out to the serial monitor of the computer the teensy is connected to.</p>\r\n                <h2>Components</h2>\r\n                <Picture link = {KareokeSchematic} description = \"Wiring of the Kareoketron 9000\" height = \"20vw\"></Picture>\r\n                <p>At the heart of the kareoketron 9000 is a teensy 4.0 microcontroller which I chose because it came with an adc and the processing power to perform the fast fourier transforms needed to pick out a note in real time. My lab also let us borrow a speaker and a microphone. I used a simple voltage divider to cut the signal in half because the adc of the teensy could only take a signal with an offset of .6V with a VPP of 1.2V while the microphone outputted a signal with an offset of 1.25V and a VPP of 2V. The slick 3D printed housing was designed and printed by my lab partner Aiden.</p>\r\n                <h2>Some Caveats</h2>\r\n                <p>One interesting thing about the human voice is that there are a lot of overtones. Sometimes the teensy would pick up on these overtones and record them into the notefrequency() function. Since I was taking the average of sound over time these miss readings of overtones would throw off the results. I ended up throwing away any datapoints that were not within 25 percent of the original note to get rid of them. This means that even if you sing the correct note an octave up or down the kareoketron 9000 will consider the note you sang incorrect. Unfortunately, we disassembled the kareoketron 9000 to return all the parts before winter break but if we were to continue development we would definitely add octave jump detection and the ability to actually sing along to music.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n    },\r\n]\r\n    \r\n    ","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano1.8f234e72.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano2.0b7e9dac.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano3.86f47768.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano4.4ef30ca3.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano5.0e77e5ae.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano5.5.94605076.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano6.35d8f7c7.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano7.72db75f3.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano8.6d7da55f.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano9.7e99b071.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano10.943bbc32.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano11.886cf992.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano12.3b65fdbf.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano13.32a0f3c1.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano14.0c1e9aa1.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano15.50be8b27.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano16.c4275d51.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano17.df59db1c.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano18.069537b9.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano19.7c0bcb97.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano20.9223216e.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano21.da26a34e.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano22.4938c099.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Cyano23.086c0c20.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Poodle.006077a5.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/ClosetHook.c56741db.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/BedHook.6431e4d2.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/GithubLogo.98a1493f.svg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/LinkedInLogo.31474d15.svg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/DevpostLogo.6a91d01e.svg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FigmaLogo.085ebcfc.svg\";","import React from 'react';\r\nimport gitHubLogo from '../Assets/GithubLogo.svg'\r\nimport linkedInLogo from '../Assets/LinkedInLogo.svg'\r\nimport devpostLogo from '../Assets/DevpostLogo.svg'\r\nimport figmaLogo from '../Assets/FigmaLogo.svg'\r\nimport '../Styles/IconBar.css';\r\n\r\n//React component that will create a little bar of icons that are linked too different sites. takes an object of keys to sites and links\r\nexport function IconBar(props) {\r\n    //key of link mapped to the different images for each icon\r\n    const linkIcons = {\r\n        github: gitHubLogo,\r\n        linkedIn: linkedInLogo,\r\n        devpost: devpostLogo,\r\n        figma: figmaLogo,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //create list of items from the link object\r\n    const items = [];\r\n    for (const key in props.links) {\r\n        items.push(<a className = \"IBLink\" href = {props.links[key]}><img className = \"IBItem\" src = {linkIcons[key]} alt = {`${key} logo link`}></img></a>)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //render items\r\n    return(\r\n        <div className = \"IBContainer\">\r\n            {items}\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","import React, { useState } from 'react';\r\nimport {cards} from './ProjectInfo.js'\r\nimport { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';\r\nimport '../Styles/CardStack.css';\r\nimport '../Styles/Card.css';\r\n//import FlipMove from 'react-flip-move';\r\nimport {IconBar} from './IconBar'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n//Display the stack of cards using the cards object from ProjectInfo.js and the status of the switch\r\nexport function CardStack(props){\r\n    const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(new Array(cards.length).fill(false));
